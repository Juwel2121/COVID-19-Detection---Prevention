## Project Overview
The **COVID-19 Detection and Prevention** project is a C++ console application aimed at providing accurate guidance and information to the public during the COVID-19 epidemic. With so much misinformation circulating, this tool helps users easily access reliable data about COVID-19 and assess their own risk based on the symptoms they report.

Through a chatbot, users can describe their symptoms, and the program categorizes their risk level based on predefined weights. The system provides instructions based on the risk category, offering advice on how to stay safe, prevent infection, and contact emergency services if necessary.

### Features

## Features
- **COVID-19 Information**: Includes general information about the virus, how it spreads, and the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the outbreak.
- **Symptom-Based Detection**: A chatbot allows users to input symptoms, which are weighted and used to determine risk level.
- **Risk Categories**:
  - **Green**: Safe, low risk.
  - **Yellow**: Mild symptoms, be cautious.
  - **Orange**: Moderate symptoms, higher risk.
  - **Red**: Severe symptoms, immediate action needed.
- **Prevention Tips**: Instructions on how to stay safe and reduce the risk of spreading or contracting the virus.
- **Emergency Contacts**: Provides contact details for emergency services and COVID-19-related hotlines.

### Chatbot Interaction Example

## Objectives
- **Promote Accurate Information**: Provide verified, reliable data about COVID-19 to users.
- **Increase Awareness**: Educate the public about COVID-19 symptoms, prevention, and risk factors.
- **Assist in Symptom Recognition**: Help users assess the likelihood of infection through symptom evaluation.
- **Provide Instructions**: Offer guidance on what to do based on infection risk.
- **Prevention Strategy**: Suggest best practices to minimize infection risk and flatten the curve.



### Example of Risk Categorization

## How It Works
The application uses a **chatbot** to interact with users and assess symptoms. Each symptom is assigned a weight, and based on the cumulative score, the user is placed in one of four risk categories (Green, Yellow, Orange, or Red). Based on this, the application provides customized instructions to guide the user on what to do next.
