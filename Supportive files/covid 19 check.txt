You are more likely to be infected with Corona virus or Covid-19.
Some urgent instructions

Since you are a health worker the risk of your corona virus infection is much higher than normal people.
Contact your nearest hospital / lab / IEDCR hotline number for PCR testing.
Contact your nearest hospital or 333, 16263, 10655 or IEDCR hotline number on Atisattar Mobile.
You must wear a mask when going to the hospital and avoid public transport or crowds.
You can have only one companion with you while traveling but you have to maintain a safe distance (3 feet) with him.

Ways to prevent corona virus

Wash your hands frequently with soap and water (more than 20 seconds at a time).
You can use sanitizer if necessary.

Avoid public gatherings unless absolutely necessary, try to stay home most of the time.
Proper hand washing rules: https://youtu.be/L-QWAi6n1Bk


There is a good chance that you will be infected with Corona virus or Covid-19, but do not be afraid to follow the instructions below.



myclinic:



Contact a health care provider within 12 hours
Your answers indicate that you have possible symptoms of COVID-19 and that you've had close contact with someone who has the condition. Based on this information, you should speak to your health care provider. You may be directed to a testing site.

Because you've had close contact with a person who has lab-confirmed COVID-19, you should quarantine for 14 days to avoid possibly spreading the infection to others.

Follow these steps:

Don't leave your home, except to get medical care.

Stay in a specific room away from others in your home, and use a separate bathroom, if possible.

Do not share household items.

Wear a mask when around others if contact is necessary.

Contact your health care provider for more advice if symptoms continue or get worse, or if new symptoms start.

Notify employee or occupational health at your work site before returning to work if you're a health care worker.

Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately if you develop symptoms like:

Ongoing pain or pressure in your chest

New confusion

A bluish color to your lips or face

Struggling to breathe

Feeling about to collapse every time you stand or sit up
