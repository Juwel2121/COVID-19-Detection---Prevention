Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.


Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness
and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people,
and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic
respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.

The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the
COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others
from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. 

The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when
an infected person coughs or sneezes, so itâ€™s important that you
also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).

single-stranded RNA virus

it was previously referred to by its provisional name, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)

There is no evidence yet to link an intermediate host, such as a pangolin, to its introduction to humans.

The virus subsequently spread to all provinces of China and to more than 200 other countries in Asia, Europe, North America, South America, Africa, and Oceania.
